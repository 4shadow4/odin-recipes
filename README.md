# odin-recipes
This is a repository for my Odin Project to learn more about HTML and to consolidate my knowledge of it.

In this project I will create a recipes website where you can switch between diffrent recipies. This website will have a homepage from wich you can navigate to all the recipes.

After this project I will have memorized all the basic tools from html.
